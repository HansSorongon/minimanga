## Disclaimer

This project is built on top of the [Mangadex](https://www.mangadex.org) API,
all credit for manga panels, manga lists, chapter lists go to them and the scanlation groups.
This is a personal project. I do not intend to use this for any sort of personal income. I'm doing
this for fun!
